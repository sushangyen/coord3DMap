# Depth & Stereo Images
Among the techniques of stereo vision, people have paid more attention to a binocular stereo vision which is based on processing two images. With OpenCV in C++, we can practically do lots of depth analysis, or even generate a 3D depth point cloud, by calling the function in the library. In this project, I tried to generate my depth map, which only included several feature points generated by ORB detector. The produced depth map could be utilized in indoor positioning in the future.
